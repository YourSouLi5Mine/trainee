What I've learned from vim: 
h -> left
j -> down
k -> up
l -> right
:q! -> quit without saving
x -> delete the character under the cursor
A -> append text
i -> insert text
:wq -> save file and exit
Operators
d -> delete
Motions
w -> until the start of the next word
e -> to the end of the current word
$ -> to the end of the line
Number repeat motions that many times
0 -> to the start of the line
dd -> delete line
u -> undo
U -> undo line changes
CTRL-R -> redo (undo the undo's)
p -> put line below
r -> replace the character with x
c -> works like d and goest into insert mode
