# Vim notes ðŸ“”

## Modes
In Vim we some modes when we are editing a document.

1. Command mode.
2. Insert mode.
3. Last line mode.

### Command mode
> To access this mode, press `ESC`.

In the command mode we will be able to press keyboard keys en do some commands wwith them, for
example, if we press `dd`, the current line where the cursor is will be deleted (now would be copied
to clipboard and could be pasted bye peressing `p`).

### Insert mode
> To access this mode enter to `Command mode`, then press `i`.

Now by being in `Insert mode` we can write text in the file.

### Last line mode
> To access this mode enter to `Command mode`, then press `:`

In `Last line mode` we enter many commands into Vim, for example:

#### Searching
This command will replace all matches in the file.
`:%s/ReplaceThis/ForThis/g`

This command will replace all matches too, but will ask for confirmation first.
`:%s/ReplaceThis/ForThis/gc
