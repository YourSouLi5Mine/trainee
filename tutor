What I've learned from vim: 
h -> left
j -> down
k -> up
l -> right
:q! -> quit without saving
x -> delete the character under the cursor
A -> append text
i -> insert text
:wq -> save file and exit
Operators
d -> delete
Motions
w -> until the start of the next word
e -> to the end of the current word
$ -> to the end of the line
Number repeat motions that many times
0 -> to the start of the line
dd -> delete line
u -> undo
U -> undo line changes
CTRL-R -> redo (undo the undo's)
p -> put line below
r -> replace the character with x
c -> works like d and goes into insert mode
G -> bottom of the file (224G moves to line 224)
gg -> top of the file
CTRL-G -> shows filename and position in the file at the bottom
/ -> search (n -> next, N -> prev)
? -> backwards search
CTRL-O -> go back to where you came from
CTRL-I -> go forward
% -> find matching ), ], }
:s/old/new -> substitutes new for old
:s/old/new/g -> line
:#,#s/old/new/g -> between lines #,#
:%s/old/new/g -> globally
:%s/old/new/gc -> globally with prompt
